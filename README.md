# ElGamal using Python

This project aims to demonstrate the security aspects of the ElGamal Encryption System. This system allows the user to encrypt / decrypt data using the ElGamal algorithm. The project will be implemented in Python programming language. 

ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange. This is considered an efficient algorithm to perform encryption and decryption as the keys are extremely tough to predict
